# WordPress.org Plugin Repository Guidelines

This is the online repository for the proposed revamp of the WordPress.org Plugin Guidelines.

## Introduction

These guidelines are intended to replace the ones currently found in the (Plugin Developer Handbook)[https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/]

The plugin review team has already gone through and made serious renovations in order to clarify intent and meaning. Many kudos to the focus groups for reading and reviewing these, to help clarify them further.

## Feedback

If you feel a guideline’s explanation is unclear, please create an issue with what you feel should be changed and why. All grammar/spelling corrections are greatly welcome. We’re trying to write these for all levels of developers, as well as people who may not speak English proficiently. Using words like ‘obsequious’ should be avoided (nb: That’s mostly to Mika who uses those words regularly).

All feedback should be opened as [issues](https://github.com/Ipstenu/wporg-plugin-guidelines) in the tracker.
