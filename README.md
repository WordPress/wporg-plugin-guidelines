# WordPress Plugin Directory Guidelines

This is the online repository for the rewrite of the WordPress.org Plugin Guidelines.

As of January 11, 2018, these guidelines match the ones on WordPress.org.

## Introduction

In 2016, an attempt was begun to clean up the [Detailed Plugin Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/) and make them easier to understand, while retaining the heart of their intent. While one might wish we could say "Don't be a gosh darn bad person or spammer!" the reality is that some people need things spelled out. But also a great many situations are difficult to summarize.

The Plugin Review Team made the first pass, followed by many volunteers at WordCamps around the world, and finally a public posting here for anyone in the community.

Since then, we have used this repository to track changes and discuss major issues and amendments to the guidelines.

## Feedback

If you feel a guideline’s explanation is unclear, please create an issue or a pull request with what you feel should be changed and why. All grammar/spelling corrections are greatly welcome. We’re trying to write these for all levels of developers, as well as people who may not speak English proficiently. Using words like ‘obsequious’ should be avoided (nb: That’s mostly to Mika who uses those words regularly).
