**9. The plugin and its developers must not do anything illegal, dishonest, or morally offensive.**

While this can feel subjective and rather broad, the intent is to prevent plugins, developers, and companies from abusing the freedoms and rights of end users as well as other plugin developers.

This includes (but is not restricted to) the following examples:

* Artificially manipulating search results via keyword stuffing, black hat SEO, or otherwise within the readme
* Offering to drive more traffic to sites that use the plugin
* Compensating, misleading, or blackmailing users for reviews
* Implying users must pay to unlock included features
* Creating accounts to generate fake reviews or support tickets (ie. sockpuppeting)
* Falsifying personal information to intentionally disguise identities and avoid sanctions for previous infractions
* Taking other developers’ plugins and presenting it as original work
* Utilizing the user’s server or resources as part of a botnet
* Violations of the [WordCamp code of conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/code-of-conduct/)
