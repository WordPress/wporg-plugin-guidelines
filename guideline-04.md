<h4>4. Original source code and  build tools must be publicly available.</h4>

We require developers to provide public, maintained access to their original source code and any build tool configuration files and custom build tools in one of the following ways:

<ul>
<li>Include the source code, any build tool configuration files and custom build tools (if any) in the deployed plugin</li>
<li>A link in the readme to the development location</li>
</ul>

We strongly recommend you document how any build tools are to be used.

Original source code must be the original edit of the code and not minified or otherwise altered after editing. 
Original source code should be written so it is clearly understandable using sensible naming conventions and comments where appropriate
and not deliberately obscured or obfuscated.
