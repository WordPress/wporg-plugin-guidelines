<h4>4. Original source code and  build tools must be publicly available.</h4>

We require developers to provide public, maintained access to their original source code and any build tool configuration files and custom build tools in one of the following ways:

<ul>
<li>Include the source code any build tool configuration files and custom build tools in the deployed plugin</li>
<li>A link in the readme to the development location<li></li>
</ul>

We strongly recommend you document how any build tools are to be used.

Original source code must be human readable and not be deliberately obscured.
